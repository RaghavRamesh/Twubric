# Twubric

###What it is?
Twubric is a simple rubric that helps a user to identify which of his/her followers to remove. 

###What it does?
This application renders the followers and allows the user to sort them by the following parameters (shortcut key in bracket)
- Number of friends ('f')
- Influence Score ('i')
- Chirpiness Score ('c')
- Total score ('t')

You can also filter the followers based on their date of joining Twitter.


###Running the application
Download or clone the repository and create a SimpleHTTPServer using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` to view the application.

###Bonus 
- Wrote a custom directive to integrate Isotope with Angular.
- Enabled keyboard short-cuts to sort followers.  
- Created a card layout for each user instead of a boring grid.
- Used ng-cloak to prevent pre-compiled Angular expressions from displaying.
